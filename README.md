A smart job recommendation system leverages machine learning, particularly decision trees and random forests, to suggest jobs tailored to user preferences. Employers can post jobs by creating company profiles, while users build personal profiles and apply for recommended or desired positions. By analyzing user inputs, such as skills, experience, and preferences, the system predicts suitable job matches. This intelligent approach enhances job search efficiency, connecting candidates with opportunities that align with their career goals and expertise.
