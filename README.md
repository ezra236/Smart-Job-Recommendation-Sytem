The project is a job recommendation system that integrates machine learning (ML) and blockchain technology. It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a dataset (combined_dataset.csv) to predict job titles based on user input like skills, salary, and experience. Predictions are stored on a blockchain via a smart contract (JobMatch.sol) for transparency and immutability. A Flask API serves as the interface, allowing users to submit data and receive predictions. The system ensures tamper-proof results by recording predictions on-chain, combining AI-driven insights with blockchain's security and transparency for reliable job recommendations.
Truffle was used.
